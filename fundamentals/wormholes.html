            <h1>Wormholes</h1>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            <p>A wormhole is the result of a black hole that warped space far enough to fuse with at least another universe.</p>
            <h2>Types</h2>
            <p>The wormhole classification is simple. The first letter represents the main type of wormhole. The second letter represents the number of connections: A is for one connection and B is for more than one connection.</p>
            <h3>Type-C</h3>
            <p>Type Connecting: They connect at least two universes together.</p>
            <h3>Type-R</h3>
            <p>Type Returning: They connect at least two points in the same universe.</p>
            <h3>Type-O</h3>
            <p>Type Open: They are open-ended and allow access to higher dimensions.</p>
