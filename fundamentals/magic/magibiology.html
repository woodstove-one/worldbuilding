        <h2>Organelles</h2>
        <h3>Dimensioholder</h3>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Dimensioholders capture and transport magic to magivaults.</p>
        <h4>Physiology</h4>
        <p>Dimensioholders are organelles with magic sensors that use localized spacetime
            distortions. They travel randomly through the host's body. When they encounter a magic particle, it is
            trapped by a special structure. This causes the dimensioholder to have a different charge. It is attracted
            towards the corresponding magivaults.</p>
        <h2>Organs</h2>
        <h3>Magivault</h3>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>The magivault stores magical energy for later use.</p>
        <h4>Physiology</h4>
        <p>The exomembrane of the magivault has channels with a charge opposite of the energy it stores. This attracts
            dimensioholders. Once the dimensioholders reach the channels, they are sucked in by a stronger attractor,
            the endoattractor. The endoattractor holds the magic securely until magic is needed.</p>
