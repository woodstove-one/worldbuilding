            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Eelah was the first nation ever formed. It was made by some of The First Sentient Beings, who are known
                as Pudtuh. The population grew rapidly, and technology advanced.</p>
            <h3>First Century</h3>
            <p>The Pudtuh formed oligarchy governments.</p>
            <h3>Third Century</h3>
            <p>Technology grew enough to allow inter-planetary travel. They also began developing nuclear weapons. The
                nearest planet to Dehfreech is Nowliqup. The Pudtuh financed explorers who wanted to colonize Nowliqup.
                As the Pudtuh received reports about new and valuable materials, some began keeping secrets. Those who
                kept secrets did not want to share their wealth.</p>
            <h3>Fourth Century</h3>
            <p>The Pudtuh who had been hiding secrets about valuable resources were all discovered within a year. Since
                they were not majority, they were banished.</p>
            <h4>Year 401</h4>
            <p>Nuclear weapon technology was finally understood and it caused more distrust between leaders of different
                cities. They were afraid of someone betraying the government and launching nuclear weapons.</p>
            <h4>Year 421</h4>
            <p>Nuclear war breaks out. The banished Pudtuh wanted revenge. The few cities who had not built strong
                defense systems were destroyed in the first year of war. However, many cities did have strong defense
                systems and took minimal damage. It was clear that nuclear war was not effective in destroying enemies.
                The fighting ended in the years 455 to 456. It confirmed the breakup of the original oligarchy
                government. They were now seperate nations.
            </p>
            <h4>Year 460</h4>
            <p>Nuclear breaks out again on Nowliqup. It is harder to transport anything there, so there was not much
                strength against nuclear weapons.</p>
